1. united airlines what is your role
I am a core UI Developer with 10+ years of experience building .com websites for different organizations using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and Redux. 
In the past 2 years, I worked on the React migration team, where I converted the .net pages to react on united.com. 
Frontend is React, and used ATMOS (Own library) components used company wide.

used middleware such as redux-saga to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls, data fetching, and impure actions in a more organized and efficient way.

Worked on Security features for users where they can manage there account like Forgot password, Forgot MileagePlus number, security questions, Sign-in features, Miles-Pooling, United Club pass,  Recent Activity, dashboard updates and KTN(Known Traveler Number), Accessibility guidelines features on united.com.

The new initiative worked on Miles-Pooling( points you get after traveling), TSA Precheck, Account security and management features, and Under18.
